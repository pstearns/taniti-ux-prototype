# D479: Taniti Tourism Website Redesign
## Task 1 - Project Prototype

This is a redesigned website for the island of Taniti. It replaces the old one-page layout with a five-page responsive design.

### Key Changes
- **Structure**: Split the information into five logical pages: Home, Explore, Stay, Transportation, and Visitor Info.
- **Navigation**: Added a persistent navigation bar to make it easier to move around.
- **Mobile Friendly**: Built with a custom CSS grid and flexbox system to work on phones and tablets.
- **Booking Options**: Included "View" and "Book Now" buttons for all lodging options.

### Viewing the Prototype
All project files are in the `prototype/` directory. To see the website, open `prototype/index.html` in any web browser.
